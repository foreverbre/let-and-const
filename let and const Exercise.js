/*What is the difference between var and let?
var you can redeclare and reassign variables, var will hoist to the top of the 
scope it is defined in, it is a function scope and you can access a hoisted variable
let you cannot redeclare variables only reassign, creates a block-scoped variable

What is the difference between var and const?
var can reassign and redeclare variables and can access a hoisted variable 
const is block-scoped and prevents a variable from being reassigned or redeclared

What is the difference between let and const?
let variables can only be reassigned 
const prevents a variable from being reassigned or redclared

What is hoisting?
hoisting happens when variables are lifted to the top of the scope they are declared in.
when using var, variable declarations are ran first before any initialization.*/
